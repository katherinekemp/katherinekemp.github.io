	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p></em> Hey! My name is Katie. </p>

	<p></em> I currently study mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am also pursuing minors in Computer Science and Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and I aspire to a career that combines each of these areas.  </p>

	<p></em> Most recently I completed a co-op at MPR Associates in Alexandria, VA, where I was able to improve my coding skills, especially in Python, as well as grow as an engineer by taking ownership of projects.  </p>

	<p></em> At UMD I’ve been involved in many organizations, two of my favorites being Celtic Grace Irish Dance Troupe and Smith Minors Ambassadors. As President of Celtic Grace Irish Dance Troupe I am able to share my love for Irish dance with the UMD community, while gaining practical experience in areas like budgeting. Smith Minors Ambassadors has provided me a great opportunity to connect with prospective students and share my passion for this great program with other students. The minor itself has given me practical business sense that will help me in future roles as well as everyday life.  </p>

	<p></em> Outside of school I love Irish dancing (obviously), traveling, and listening to podcasts. Check out my blog to see where my travels have taken me and reach out if you have any podcast recommendations. Some of my favorites are “How I Built This” with Guy Raz, “Reply All” with PJ Vogt, Alex Goldman and Emmanuel Dzotsi, and “My Favorite Murder” with Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark. </p>
